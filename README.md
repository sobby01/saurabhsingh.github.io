# My Jekyll Blog

Welcome to my Jekyll-based blog! This repository uses the "Just the Docs" theme and is designed to serve as a hub for my technical documentation, system design insights, low-level design ideas, and coding patterns.

## Documentation Sections

This repository is organized into three main documentation folders:

1. [System Design](docs/system-design/): Explore various aspects of system design, from architectural patterns to scalability considerations.

2. [Low-Level Design](docs/low-level-design/): Dive into the details of low-level design principles and best practices for creating efficient and maintainable software.

3. [Coding Patterns](docs/coding-patterns/): Discover a collection of coding patterns and techniques that can help improve code quality and readability.

## Getting Started

Each documentation folder contains Markdown files that delve into specific aspects of the corresponding topic. These files provide insights, ideas, and practical advice, making it easy for you to access the information you're looking for.

Get started by selecting the area that interests you the most and embark on a journey of continuous learning and improvement.
